# Overview

This is my first C++ program developed in trying to learn and understand how C++ can be utilized and to also learn the syntax of this language. I wanted to create something that will help me in my software engineering career for the future.

This software takes up to five txt files and combines them in the order that you choose.

I wrote this software because I wanted to develop my skills in C++ as much as I could. I stretched myself by learning vectors, classes, and file manipulation

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
